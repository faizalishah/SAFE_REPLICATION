    <text>This is a great game. The characters are clever, I love the title music, and the storyline is original and creative. However, there are flaws.

    <text>I waited until I broke through #11 to rate this app. When I did succeed, I was nearly giddy with pride. After a few easy levels, I am again practicing my aim. The puzzles are fun and I am looking forward to another success Yes, I am stuck again. It is way too much fun to quit, thus still a 5 rating! 5 again, yet - I find that an explosion on TV gets me a little excited. That's new for me. I enjoy your creativity to find ever more and different puzzles for me. The times I out do myself give me pleasure and am excited to see what is next. Thanks! Still enjoy the black exploding birds - the finality they offer. My aim is improving with a better ratio of 3 star efforts. Thanks for the fun! You still preoccupy me happily! M I had to give one level to the eagle and have been playing lots of solitaire to help recover. Now I am ready to go back and give it another try. The ability to pick up and retry gives the game yet another 5 stars. Hi, my aim has improved as has my ability to figure out how to get 3 stars on most all levels. It is fun to get help from the characters with special powers when I am really stuck. However I do not get help unless I feel tapped out. Thanks for all the fun. Mary</text>

    <text>First, they ruined the icon. Okay, nobody cared about the icon anyways. We can live with that. Then they add stupid power ups. Now you can no longer brag if you got 3 stars in every level because people can just say you used power ups. Okay, we'll use the honor system about how you got the stars. Then they add the stupid cartoon thing. They really should have put that in a separate app or something, but I guess it'll be a feature I'll never use. Now they completely changed the gameplay in the newest episode into the lamest thing ever. I'm sorry ROVIO, but you have betrayed gamers everywhere because of your greed and stupidity. You have lost credibility as good videogame company. That's why you don't see angry birds at the top of the charts anymore.

    <text>People are complaining about the new update of Angry Birds. It's just an ADDITION of levels to the original game with a twist, and it's NOT that bad. Sure, it's different from the previous levels, but it's unique and could get a bit challenging if you play the whole thing instead of just playing two levels and saying it's horrible. I'm sure there will be more levels of the same classic Angry Birds coming soon, so all the complainers need to take a seat and be patient. Great job on the game, Rovio! And for all who don't have the game, don't let these reviews prevent you from getting it. You don't have an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch unless Angry Birds is on it. P.S.

    <text>I guess I'm defective or something. I just don't get why Angry Birds is fun. To me it seems like the Splenda of games, it gives the impression of being fun without actually being fun. There is no sense of accomplishment for completing a level. I don't have a good sense of what actually kills the pigs, versus just wounding them, and any results I get don't seem at all repeatable from one attempt to the next. As a result, failures are frustrating because the controls fight my attempts at precision, and successes are unsatisfying because it feels like I just caught a lucky break. This isn't to say the game isn't addictive, but addictive and fun aren't the same. I find myself continuing because I don't want to be the guy that was beaten by a 99 cent app rather than because I'm enjoying myself. Obvious it's me, since everyone else loves the game and buys the toys and shower curtains at Target. But I just don't get it.</text>

    <text>Seriously, this game has sapped all my free time. I started playing this game a couple of days ago. I heard about it on The Late Show with Jimmy Fallon, some actor was talking about PvZ (it's okay), and he mentioned Angry Birds. I recognized it as its been number one for a while now. This game is too good. I struggle not to play this during meetings and I'm sure my wife will divorce me when age catches me playing this game while we're having sex. Simple to complex strategy and puzzle game. The graphics are adorable. I want to stab the pigs when they grin after you fail a map. Get this game and kiss &quot;free time&quot; good-bye!! Update 3-7-2013 Still a fantastic game. Great levels have been added, and it's been awesome!</text>

    <text>Update: I really do not like the new tab-based interface. It's very slow and unwieldy on my iPhone 4. It's hard to tap and drag the headers. They're not very responsive, and the slow animation between tabs is just useless fluff that gets in the way of speedily making and finding notes. Also, using the same view in landscape mode is really ugly and wastes screen real estate. I still like many aspects of Evernote, but it is important that you keep the focus on usability and functionality, rather than cute interface magic. It is very frustrating to be watching slow animations when I want to make a quick note. Furthermore, too much key info is buried. Tags, location, etc. I have to go through too many menus and dialogs to change these and then go back back back to my notes. And now we also can't see our notes on the map filtered by tag. I can't look at just my cafes or restaurants or meetings on the map. That makes the map pretty useless (on top of apple maps being horrendous). I appreciate the efforts to improve, but this interface was a step backwards actually. It constantly gets in my way and frustrates me. ---------------------- Evernote, THANK YOU! The latest update makes your app slick and quick. No more crashing, fast slick uploading, proper non-buggy text entry, and proper functioning of folders!! In particular, the text entry is a BIG deal. I was very disappointed in the weird behavior previously with spaces and line breaks. I was getting worried about relying on Evernote for all my stuff.. But you did it right this time. THANKS!</text>

    <text>Update, EN performance has improved considerably (from 2 to 3 stars) since my last review, however the app remains pretty buggy. It constantly reports failure to synch, it freezes momentarily between all actions, it crashes here and thee, and the search function sometimes fails to find key words. I am borderline thinking of going premium, but also keeping an eye for alternatives. Note, some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7. Previous review, After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade. The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting. Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK. On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together. The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp; Mac desktop versions. I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives. I don't have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues.</text>

At the moment, you can't copy/paste text, many users (myself included) have reported a typing bug where the cursor jumps when you try to type, rendering the note taking part useless. On design flaws: you can't create a new notebook in the app mode, the interface is quite rigid and doesn't flow like the rest if apples iOS, you can't add notebooks to the shortcut section (though you can delete them..), and so on. I personally think it should be easier to manage your Evernote on a phone without accessing a computer. Still, get the app if you don't have it.

    <text>I love, love, love Evernote! It is the only way I remember anything. Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible! The new interface seems to have buried things I want most. Such as Sync Now and Search. Sync seems to be broken regardless. I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence. Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in. Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient. If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders. Again, working like the desktop version would be better here. Finally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag. Not just the first word in the tag. The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault. It is the buggiest iOS I can remember. I'm not mad. Just frustrated. 2 stars is a reflection on the iOS version, not the Evernote across platforms.</text>

I heavily used the indent option to organize my notes. If this option is truly removed then I will really have to rethink how I take my notes. I hope it is still possible, but I just can't find it (or they add it in a patch). I know there is an outline feature (with either dots or numbers, this is not the feature I commonly use.

    <text>The latest updates are really frustrating me. Because I am used to writing large amounts of text per note, it makes it extremely difficult to get the entirety of each note to load, and then to enter type mode.

Then, with each update, the app got slower and slower and frankly, uglier and uglier.

I did not foresee such a drastic loss as possible, so I do not have these notes archived elsewhere. if I am to use an app that allows for this much thought and effort to be stored within it, I need to be able to trust that my work will not be lost with a simple touch screen selection error.

Good intentions, and probably the most functional of the apps I have tried. But let's face it - they are all pretty clunky. Evernote seems to build &quot;islands of stuff&quot; - text, pictures, URLs, etc. editing any of that becomes problematic. And when you email or cut&amp;paste into something else - it is a nightmare. One of the big reasons I looked at it is because I wanted to use bullets, numbers, outlining in my notes -- so I was SOOO happy to see those in the app. BUT LET'S FACE IT - they basically don't work!!!! They flake out, have irrational spacing, when you try to edit or move them they will most likely just disappear!! Thank God for the un-do command.

    <text>Updates not so good.. Agree with others who commented about &quot;sub boards&quot;, definitely would be great for holidays. I also wouldn't mind an option to pin to multiple boards.

Next problem, related to this is the &quot;Near Me&quot; function. First, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town. When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse. The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house. Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's a lot less functional than the website. Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed.

    <text>whenever i establish a relationship with a vendor who requires an email address from me, i give them an email address unique to just them. i give that email address to no-one else and, in most circumstances, i will never send an email _from_ that email address. that is exactly what i did with dropbox. i signed up for a dropbox account almost a year ago, on march 21, 2012. i immediately received the standard &quot;welcome&quot; email. over the course of the next nine months i received exactly three additional marketing-type emails from them. then i started getting spam/phishing emails. on 19-feb-2013 i received an email saying my direct deposit had been disallowed; on 26-feb-2013 i received an email indicating new security was being put in place for ACH and EFT transactions; and on both 27-feb and 28-feb-2013 i received an email asking me to join a linkedin account. all four emails were phishing emails. since i have never shared that email address with anyone, since i had never sent any email _from_ that address, and since the emails were all phishing emails, then one of three things has happened: - dropbox sold, gave away, or otherwise shared my information with one or more dubious with parties. - someone hacked dropbox's systems and stole my information. - dropbox has one or more rogue employees who is using customer information for their own benefit. i used dropbox's web form to contact two different departments about the security breach, and i also sent two email messages about the security breach from the email address i had given them but to date i haven't heard a single thing. dropbox has a legal obligation to inform all impacted customers about any security breach. a security breach is what happened here and they are nowhere near fulfilling that obligation.</text>

    <text>I have been using several other apps for my notes, but none was so easy to use across PC, Mac, iPad and, yes, even Blackberry. After the last upgrade I started using Skitch. At the beginning I had doubts about moving to a second app to edit PDFs; but no more. Its quite fluid and works very well. I even liked the fact that I could edit the PDF and then go back to Evernote for actual notes without having to quite the PDF. The only couple of things is that I still miss the Stacking in the iOS version and no editing in shared notebooks. Other than that, It's a great App</text>

    <text>They are trying to push vacation listings, but you can't drill down to a neighborhood . Orlando is a big area and you get a zillion listings that come up. I need one near a particular neighborhood. You can't search for that and going through all their postings for Orlando isn't feasible. Use airbnb instead. They know what they are doing. You can put in any address where you need to be and listings pop up all around it. How can you miss something as simple as this? Those that have a listing on trip advisor must be losing out.

    <text>Better than Tumblr! NEW RATING! UPDATE: 2/3/14 Pinterest needs to not take up 50 MBS on my phone, I will be uninstalling this app soon if not changed,even if I love it. Faster, easier , and more options to use. When Pinterest was introduced I thought it was stupid that they're trying to replace Tumblr because at that time it wasn't so slow and had not gone through the major face-lift yet.

    <text>When I got my ipad, all I wanted for productivity was the &quot;voice memo&quot; app, and the &quot;notes&quot; app... Much to my surprise, the ipad does not have a native voice memo app... But Evernote has made said apps obsolete. Voice memos in the same note as the text, multiples of each tying to the same idea. Easy to find... Easy to share... I haven't even begun to take advantage of the potential of this app... meta organization of all of my notes / categories / sub categories.... In summary, Evernote is the end all for recording all the little things you'd want to remember, and makes it easy to organize and find, in more ways than you'd expect. Get it now.</text>

    <text>I already own Penultimate and have kept it up to date. I've tried Evernote at various times, same with Penultimate, but there isn't an intuitive start-up instructions on integrating the two; at least not that I've found. That's the principal problem with all iOS programs. And the App Store is ZERO help. I could keep going, but Apple owns these and probably won't put this up under the program rating. Additionally, the In-App offerings don't make sense and I have a post graduate degree from UC.</text>

    <text>Travel a lot for work in the US and now globally. Also love to travel on my own time off and Trip Advisor is great. It has a lot of information. It is very helpful - from St. Louis to San Isidro. I highly recommend it to novice and seasoned travelers alike! It is also easy to use and has a lot of really useful functionalities. Just remember that the reviews come from users so you should read a few before making a decision - and even potential check another source just for reference. And remember that it doesn't work if you are off line! So make sure - especially if you are traveling somewhere where you may not have data service to have a source handy that isn't dependent on being 'connected.' But then again - when are we ever not connected any more!</text>

    <text>The best resource for finding a decent place to stay. I have never been sorry for having read the reviews here. You have to be logical when deciding who to believe, so here is my formula: What is the over-all rating? What is the opinion of those people who stayed there recently? What are the complaints? What do you want from your stay? How much do you want to spend? Is it worth it? That formula has always worked for me, and I depend on Trip Advisor anytime I am unfamiliar with a destination and need a place to stay.</text>

    <text>I've been a premium Evernote user for quite a while, and have loads of content and important data in their system. This latest version renders it completely useless.

As a paying customer I cannot continue to use tools that can't function with a high level of reliability.

    <text>Wouldn't sync on 4G (data worked perfectly when using other apps). All progress was gone until I came home and logged back in to my Rovio account using my wifi, which means all my progress will be gone when I'm offline (on an airplane etc). A sure downside to the cloud functionality. I've already had to start from scratch many times when I'm playing on a new device. One more thing, the original Angry Birds theme song is so much better than the new version. Bring it back! Update: Thank you for bringing back the original theme song! Love it!

    <text>Angry Birds has always been one of my favorite games, up until recently. It has become very buggy and slow, completely unpredictable and unreliable. I still try but it usually doesn't work.

    <text>I use Dropbox every day. This app is how I backup my notes, transfer them between all my devices, and access them to study. My issue is that all my notes are large PDFs. For some reason, when I load a file, the file seems to get stored in the app data for dropbox. And it seems like more than that gets stored in there because after a while I end up with a dropbox app taking up 1+GB of space on my iPad. This is difficult because I have a 16GB iPad and have lots of other apps on here for studying and need to conserve space. The only way I have found to clear this memory is to uninstall the app every time it balloons, which, as you can probably guess, is extremely annoying. If someone can tell me an easier way to clear this space or if Dropbox can fix this issue, this would be a five star app for me.</text>

    <text>I gotta say, overall I like this app, although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me. I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth. The reason is because I start downloading the whole file, then start streaming it. Once the 15 min is up, I then switch to the downloaded file. To me, this uses more data. Why can't I just stream the whole thing? Overall, though, I like everything else about this app.</text>

  <sentence id="1649">
    <text>Thanks to the staff and management for making my 1st trip to London so fabulous! From uniforms (doorman especially) to spotless rooms and common spaces it was unexpected quality and service. Dinning is A+ but being from the US I didn't get the pork and beans on the breakfast buffet. Try a steak sandwich in the tea area it's wonderful along with the cute and delicious little bites they serve with tea. Too posh. No need to prebook tours in US the Concierge staff can do it and know more about the sites. Basically, I loved this place, so I'm planing a trip to London by myself and feel totally secure,safe, and familiar with the area and hotel! Cee ya soon. Byudeva</text>

    <text>We arrived at dollar with a 2 pm reservation plus the rapid service I signed up for last week. It's now been over an hour in line. The placed is mobed with hundreds of customers in line yet very very few counters open. It's about 40% running. There is no where to sit and crying babies and disappointed families in every corner. Food is on the floor and the place is complete disarray. I will never rent of the dump again. I would rather walk. Actually if I had walked to Pasadena I would be almost there. Plus the staff are rude and ignorant. No compassion for the customers standing in this never ending line rather than be with their families for Xmas. My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mom. She has a whole dinner planned tonight. Unfortunately we will be here at dollar waiting for our pre reserved rental car. Rush hour starts in 30 minutes, that will end any chance of seeing my family tonight. Shame on dollar for not properly staffing their rental car center during the important holiday season.</text>

    <text>I use this for so many things. I take notes in meetings, training, phone calls...they all go in Evernote. I have multiple clients and I have a notebook on everyone of them. I share notes with my employees, friends and clients. I even have notebooks for new recipes, health tips, and for my hobbies. I used to fill up 12 notebooks a year and then when I needed to find something I would have to flip thru multiple notebooks to find that notation. Not anymore. I do a quick search and voila... I have the note at my fingertips in seconds. :)</text>

    <text>Don't attempt to edit your board description. Apparently, when editing a long board description using this app, it erases everything on the right that you're not able to see.

    <text>I love this app and think it's great but with one of the latest updates I seem to be having some issues with previously downloaded video playbacks? I use guitar practice mini-videos and in the past the videos I saved as my favorites played instantaneously but now, every now and then I have to re-download them all over again? I want to keep them in my Dropbox because I use the mini-videos for guitar practice while overseas where often I have no or limited wi-fi (don't use network as it's very expensive to roam overseas). Not sure why I have to re-download those videos every now and then? Often they'll work fine for weeks at a time and then all of a sudden I have to download them again? Otherwise it's a great app and this is just a small glitch.</text>

    <text>I really like this app but but for an app that is supposed to automatically sync this one has a big hole. I was using this to do some testing of an ePub file I found that syncing didn't work. I selected the ebook and sent it to an app. So far so good. I found some errors which I fixed on my PC and reloaded the file on Dropbox. I then went back to Dropbox on my iPad and used the pull down which showed it to be my latest. I pushed the file to my test reader but it was still the old file! My work around is to select some other file on Dropbox and then reselected the real file and pushed it again. This time it worked. Hopefully this will get fixed.</text>

    <text>I have been playing Angry Birds for a while and love it. But the latest level just takes this game to a new level of low. Honestly, was this designed for a group of semi-literate morons who need to be hand held through the game? Part of the fun is getting through a level only to find its good for one star and working to clear it to three. That's gone. There is no excitement here. Pass. The Angry Birds may have come home to roost.</text>

    <text>People are complaining about the new update of Angry Birds. It's just an ADDITION of levels to the original game with a twist, and it's NOT that bad. Sure, it's different from the previous levels, but it's unique and could get a bit challenging if you play the whole thing instead of just playing two levels and saying it's horrible. I'm sure there will be more levels of the same classic Angry Birds coming soon, so all the complainers need to take a seat and be patient. Great job on the game, Rovio! And for all who don't have the game, don't let these reviews prevent you from getting it. You don't have an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch unless Angry Birds is on it. P.S. I don't work for Rovio or anything, F.Y.I.</text>

    <text>I used to be able to view .xls files on my iPad AND iPhone. I can still view them on my iPhone but they no longer open on the iPad. Sometimes the files will open for a few seconds and then a gray screen comes up. Most of the time I just get the gray screen. The gray screen has the file name, &quot;Office Open XML Spreadsheet&quot;' and the file size. My spreadsheets are simple (no macros) and small in size. I've tried creating new spreadsheets and have the same issue. Web research shows others have same issue but no fixes have worked for me. I'm on the latest IOS 7.0.4 and the most recent version of Dropbox 3.0.1. Chat with Apple Support says it is a DropBox issue.</text>

    <text>They miss the mark, literally. It is super frustrating because the aim is off. The bird never seems to go exactly where I want. Maybe the arrow is forcing auto aim or something but if the pig is in the middle of a contraption but there's some other weak point, like TNT then I want to aim at that. Right now it's essentially &quot;button mashing&quot; throwing as many birds in as fast as possible and hoping a few hit close to the mark. Of course the delays at the start of each level aren't helping either. Let me start attacking right away, don't let the pigs have a 5 second jump on me.</text>

    <text>You are ruining this super fun game!</text>
  </sentence>
  <sentence id="3892">
    <text>There was nothing wrong with the old version, and this new one eliminates one of the apps most useful features: previously your saved restaurants, hotels, etc, were automatically sorted by location, now all of them are shown at once which is really confusing. True you can ask to see your saved hotels in say only Chicago, but if you then want to look for your saved restaurants in Chicago, you have to do a second sort. This is a pain especially when you are in a location with a poor signal. If you don't have this app, it's certainly worthwhile, but if you do take a careful look at the latest version before you upgrade.</text>
