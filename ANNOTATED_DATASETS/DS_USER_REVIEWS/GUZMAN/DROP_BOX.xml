    <text>My wife and I share a 100GB account, and it's amazing! So many things: Automatic photo/video upload, iPhoto import, works with the Mailbox app, shared folders, photo aggregation on the website and mobile, the ability to store files only on the cloud (saves space on my Mac from old files)... ...and the obvious things like having everything backed up in real-time, and accessibility of my files from anywhere. I could do without it anymore! Remember when we just had computers and hoped they didn't break and lose all our files? One suggestion: if I have automatic photo upload on and download a photo to my phone's camera roll (say, for #TBT), don't automatically re-upload it to Camera Imports! It's already in Dropbox, silly. And yes, obviously if I use Instagram or some other photo sharing software to doctor it, I know it's a different photo and will therefore upload.</text>

Refresh Button 3. Button that Refreshes the Current Folder's contents. 4. The air smells a bit. Why don't we REFRESH it? 5. It is stupidly simple to add a refresh button 6. Mentos: The Refresh Button Maker 7. There's space on the top left of the app header to add a refresh button. Nothing is there at the moment. It's lonely... 8.
