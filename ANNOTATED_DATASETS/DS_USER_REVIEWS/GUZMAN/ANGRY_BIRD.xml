    <text>This is a great game. The characters are clever, I love the title music, and the storyline is original and creative. However, there are flaws.

    <text>I waited until I broke through #11 to rate this app. When I did succeed, I was nearly giddy with pride. After a few easy levels, I am again practicing my aim. The puzzles are fun and I am looking forward to another success Yes, I am stuck again. It is way too much fun to quit, thus still a 5 rating! 5 again, yet - I find that an explosion on TV gets me a little excited. That's new for me. I enjoy your creativity to find ever more and different puzzles for me. The times I out do myself give me pleasure and am excited to see what is next. Thanks! Still enjoy the black exploding birds - the finality they offer. My aim is improving with a better ratio of 3 star efforts. Thanks for the fun! You still preoccupy me happily! M I had to give one level to the eagle and have been playing lots of solitaire to help recover. Now I am ready to go back and give it another try. The ability to pick up and retry gives the game yet another 5 stars. Hi, my aim has improved as has my ability to figure out how to get 3 stars on most all levels. It is fun to get help from the characters with special powers when I am really stuck. However I do not get help unless I feel tapped out. Thanks for all the fun. Mary</text>

    <text>First, they ruined the icon. Okay, nobody cared about the icon anyways. We can live with that. Then they add stupid power ups. Now you can no longer brag if you got 3 stars in every level because people can just say you used power ups. Okay, we'll use the honor system about how you got the stars. Then they add the stupid cartoon thing. They really should have put that in a separate app or something, but I guess it'll be a feature I'll never use. Now they completely changed the gameplay in the newest episode into the lamest thing ever. I'm sorry ROVIO, but you have betrayed gamers everywhere because of your greed and stupidity. You have lost credibility as good videogame company. That's why you don't see angry birds at the top of the charts anymore.

    <text>People are complaining about the new update of Angry Birds. It's just an ADDITION of levels to the original game with a twist, and it's NOT that bad. Sure, it's different from the previous levels, but it's unique and could get a bit challenging if you play the whole thing instead of just playing two levels and saying it's horrible. I'm sure there will be more levels of the same classic Angry Birds coming soon, so all the complainers need to take a seat and be patient. Great job on the game, Rovio! And for all who don't have the game, don't let these reviews prevent you from getting it. You don't have an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch unless Angry Birds is on it. P.S.

    <text>I guess I'm defective or something. I just don't get why Angry Birds is fun. To me it seems like the Splenda of games, it gives the impression of being fun without actually being fun. There is no sense of accomplishment for completing a level. I don't have a good sense of what actually kills the pigs, versus just wounding them, and any results I get don't seem at all repeatable from one attempt to the next. As a result, failures are frustrating because the controls fight my attempts at precision, and successes are unsatisfying because it feels like I just caught a lucky break. This isn't to say the game isn't addictive, but addictive and fun aren't the same. I find myself continuing because I don't want to be the guy that was beaten by a 99 cent app rather than because I'm enjoying myself. Obvious it's me, since everyone else loves the game and buys the toys and shower curtains at Target. But I just don't get it.</text>

    <text>Seriously, this game has sapped all my free time. I started playing this game a couple of days ago. I heard about it on The Late Show with Jimmy Fallon, some actor was talking about PvZ (it's okay), and he mentioned Angry Birds. I recognized it as its been number one for a while now. This game is too good. I struggle not to play this during meetings and I'm sure my wife will divorce me when age catches me playing this game while we're having sex. Simple to complex strategy and puzzle game. The graphics are adorable. I want to stab the pigs when they grin after you fail a map. Get this game and kiss &quot;free time&quot; good-bye!! Update 3-7-2013 Still a fantastic game. Great levels have been added, and it's been awesome!</text>

    <text>Was one of the greatest games ever, then they incorporated the worst game play in it. It's no longer the good ol' game with the good ol' birds it use to be. I was disappointed with the bubble bird, but I trekked on. Then the uncontrollable birds came.. I thought thats what they created all the various spin offs you had to buy for. Or at least if they destroy the game they could of made it a game extra with no star ratings so the players who actually play the game wouldn't get offended. If I could of foreseen this, I wouldn't of wasted my money. I don't even believe it deserves the one star I had to give it to post this review. Heed. This. Warning!</text>
