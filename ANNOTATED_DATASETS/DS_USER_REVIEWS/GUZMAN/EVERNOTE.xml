    <text>I find the interface to be awkward, but the biggest fault w this app is its poor syncing across devices.

In Evernote, I have to manually refresh and if I make a change on one device then another without refreshing on the first device, I get a note that there was a &quot;conflicting&quot; edit. What is the point of a note app that isn't constantly saving and refreshing? And this isn't just the case over a few minutes' time; I've had notes not change over the course of weeks--I have to to go to the last device I made changes on, refresh, and then refresh again on the other device.

    <text>Update: I really do not like the new tab-based interface. It's very slow and unwieldy on my iPhone 4. It's hard to tap and drag the headers. They're not very responsive, and the slow animation between tabs is just useless fluff that gets in the way of speedily making and finding notes. Also, using the same view in landscape mode is really ugly and wastes screen real estate. I still like many aspects of Evernote, but it is important that you keep the focus on usability and functionality, rather than cute interface magic. It is very frustrating to be watching slow animations when I want to make a quick note. Furthermore, too much key info is buried. Tags, location, etc. I have to go through too many menus and dialogs to change these and then go back back back to my notes. And now we also can't see our notes on the map filtered by tag. I can't look at just my cafes or restaurants or meetings on the map. That makes the map pretty useless (on top of apple maps being horrendous). I appreciate the efforts to improve, but this interface was a step backwards actually. It constantly gets in my way and frustrates me. ---------------------- Evernote, THANK YOU! The latest update makes your app slick and quick. No more crashing, fast slick uploading, proper non-buggy text entry, and proper functioning of folders!! In particular, the text entry is a BIG deal. I was very disappointed in the weird behavior previously with spaces and line breaks. I was getting worried about relying on Evernote for all my stuff.. But you did it right this time. THANKS!</text>

    <text>Update, EN performance has improved considerably (from 2 to 3 stars) since my last review, however the app remains pretty buggy. It constantly reports failure to synch, it freezes momentarily between all actions, it crashes here and thee, and the search function sometimes fails to find key words. I am borderline thinking of going premium, but also keeping an eye for alternatives. Note, some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7. Previous review, After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade. The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting. Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK. On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together. The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp; Mac desktop versions. I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives. I don't have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues.</text>

At the moment, you can't copy/paste text, many users (myself included) have reported a typing bug where the cursor jumps when you try to type, rendering the note taking part useless. On design flaws: you can't create a new notebook in the app mode, the interface is quite rigid and doesn't flow like the rest if apples iOS, you can't add notebooks to the shortcut section (though you can delete them..), and so on.

    <text>I love, love, love Evernote! It is the only way I remember anything. Their generous monthly allotment of new storage space is incredible! The new interface seems to have buried things I want most. Such as Sync Now and Search. Sync seems to be broken regardless. I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence. Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in. Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient. If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders. Again, working like the desktop version would be better here. Finally, it would be nice if tag searching worked like it does on the web version of Evernote, evaluating the entire tag. Not just the first word in the tag. The iOS version is a bit buggy but that may be all iOS 7's fault. It is the buggiest iOS I can remember. I'm not mad. Just frustrated. 2 stars is a reflection on the iOS version, not the Evernote across platforms.</text>

    <text>I use Evernote a lot. It is my primary note app. The redesign is interesting. I think it will something I will really enjoy once I get used to it. That is if I can find out how to indent. There used to be a format option/tab above the keyboard in the earlier version. This provided the ability to do many formatting changes to notes you take. Some of these options remain, but not all. I heavily used the indent option to organize my notes. If this option is truly removed then I will really have to rethink how I take my notes. I hope it is still possible, but I just can't find it (or they add it in a patch). I know there is an outline feature (with either dots or numbers, this is not the feature I commonly use. I just want to indent). I still like the app and do not think it deserves a low review, but one of my most used features might have just been removed. I cannot give this update a 5.

Good intentions, and probably the most functional of the apps I have tried. But let's face it - they are all pretty clunky. Evernote seems to build &quot;islands of stuff&quot; - text, pictures, URLs, etc. editing any of that becomes problematic. And when you email or cut&amp;paste into something else - it is a nightmare. One of the big reasons I looked at it is because I wanted to use bullets, numbers, outlining in my notes -- so I was SOOO happy to see those in the app. BUT LET'S FACE IT - they basically don't work!!!! They flake out, have irrational spacing, when you try to edit or move them they will most likely just disappear!! Thank God for the un-do command.
